            Emaâ€™s journey into filmmaking was anything but conventional. She honed her skills as a cinematographer, director, and video journalist, working with networks like BBC, Vice News and Bloomberg. Her ability to blend intimate, human-driven storytelling with striking visuals has made her one of the most distinct voices in contemporary African cinema.

            Her films go beyond the surface, capturing the raw, real, and often overlooked narratives of everyday life. With a career spanning over a decade, she has carved a niche in the industry, creating films that speak to Nigerian audiences at home and in the diaspora while resonating with a global audience.
